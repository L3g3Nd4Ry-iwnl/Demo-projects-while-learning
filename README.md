## Vue-js-Brad-Traversy

[Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs) <br/>
This course helped me to get a grasp on the basics of Vue.js. It essentialy had me work on 2 projects.
1. Random user generator
> A simple frontend that has a person his details and blue color border for men and pink for women (No gender sterotypes, just a color!) around their picture, if the "Get Random User" is clicked the vue app makes an api call to "https://randomuser.me/api" to retrieve and display the details of the person. <br/><br/> No need to run any backend, vue cdn is used for this project, just the index.html can be opened and played with.
2. Task-tacker
> This is a REST API app. It has 2 end points, / , /about. / is the home page where the tasks can be seen, new tasks added, tasks deleted, reminders toggled. /about is used to display the version of task tracker. The app is made up of routes and components. I used a json-server to host my task list locally so the changes are stored even if the page/server is reloaded. <br/>
> To run the app:
> 1. npm install
> 2. npm run backend - in a separate terminal
> 3. npm run serve - in a separate terminal
