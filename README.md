## Vue-js-Brad-Traversy

[Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs) <br/>
This course helped me to get a grasp on the basics of Vue.js. It essentialy had me work on 2 projects.
1. Random user generator
> A simple frontend that has a person his details and blue color border for men and pink for women (No gender sterotypes, just a color!) around their picture, if the "Get Random User" is clicked the vue app makes an api call to "https://randomuser.me/api" to retrieve and display the details of the person. <br/><br/> No need to run any backend, vue cdn is used for this project, just the index.html can be opened and played with.
2. Task-tacker
> This is a REST API app. It has 2 end points, / , /about. / is the home page where the tasks can be seen, new tasks added, tasks deleted, reminders toggled. /about is used to display the version of task tracker. The app is made up of routes and components. I used a json-server to host my task list locally so the changes are stored even if the page/server is reloaded. <br/>
> To run the app:
> 1. npm install
> 2. npm run backend - in a separate terminal
> 3. npm run serve - in a separate terminal

## Web-Development-SmartKnower

This was a paid internship with SmartKnower in which I learned on the basics of Web development. I was expected to complete 2 projects,
1. Major Project
> This project was done by myself and [Tharun Kumar A.](https://github.com/TharunKumar107) This is a live HTML, CSS, Js editor. This project was simple since our knowledge on the tech stack was little back then. The tech stack being HTML, CSS, Js. It has an home page, about page and an editor.

2. Minor Project
> A simple page on GTA 5, definitely not on the awesome level but something I did back then with very less knowledge. The tech stack being HTML, CSS.
